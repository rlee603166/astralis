ACTION_PROMPT: |
  Based *only* on the detailed thought process provided:
  <thought>
  {thought}
  </thought>

  Carefully choose the *single best next action* to take from the available tools:
  - search_vector_db(query: str, namespace: str, top_k: int): Searches the specified namespace ['education', 'experience', 'skill', 'summary'] in the vector database based on semantic meaning. Returns top-k matches including user IDs. Use this for finding candidates based on descriptions, roles, skills, or overall profile similarity.
    - IMPORTANT: Format the 'query' parameter precisely according to the target namespace's expected content for best results. Examples:
      - summary namespace: "A full career description..." (e.g., "Accomplished electrical engineer with power systems experience...")
      - education namespace: "'degree_type' in 'degree_name' from 'university_name'" (e.g., "Master's in Electrical Engineering at Stanford")
      - experience namespace: "'job_title' at 'company_name'. Job Description: 'keywords or description matching user intent'" (e.g., "Software Engineer at Google. Job Description: Developing backend systems for cloud infrastructure")
      - skill namespace: "Skills: 'skill1, skill2, skill3, ...'" (e.g., "Skills: Python, Financial Modeling, Investment Analysis")
  - fetch_profile(user_id: str): Retrieves the complete profile data (experiences, education, skills, projects) for a single, specific user ID. Use this when you need full details about a user already identified.
  - filter_structured(filters: Dict[str, Any], user_ids: List[str]): Filters a *provided list* of user IDs based on structured criteria from their profiles. Returns the filtered list of user IDs. Use this action to *refine* results from a previous step.
  - **Supported Filters (Keys in `filters` dictionary):**
    - `location` (str): Filters users who have experience in a location containing this string (case-insensitive substring match).
    - `company_name` (str): Filters users who have experience at a company name containing this string (case-insensitive substring match).
    - `job_title` (str): Filters users who have held a job title containing this string (case-insensitive substring match).
    - `skill` (str): Filters users who list this exact skill (case-insensitive).
  - **Input Requirements:**
    - `filters` (Dict): A dictionary specifying the filter criteria (e.g., `{{"location": "California"}}`).
    - `user_ids` (List[str]): **Crucially, this MUST be a list of the actual user ID strings (UUIDs)** obtained from the `result` field of the *most recent previous step* that returned a list of users (usually `search_vector_db` or a prior `filter_structured`). **Do NOT use names or placeholders.**
  <example_input>
  {{
    "filters": {{ "skill": "Python" }},
    "user_ids": ["2e053b25-c2de-4a9f-aac8-1e1e73983435", "c8d28ffd-b898-4913-bc02-6aa285065934"] # <-- Actual UUIDs
  }}
  </example_input>

  - request_clarification(question: str): Ask the user a question to clarify their request or gather missing information needed to proceed effectively. Use this if the query is too vague (e.g., "Find experts"), ambiguous (e.g., "engineers" - which type?), or lacks details required for a filter (e.g., user asks to filter by location but doesn't specify where). Execution pauses after asking.
    <example_input>
    {{
      "question": "What type of engineers are you looking for (e.g., software, mechanical, electrical)?"
    }}
    </example_input>
  - finish: Use this action ONLY when the user's request has been fully addressed, you have gathered the necessary information/profiles, and you are ready to generate the final summary response.

  Output your decision STRICTLY in this format:
  <action>
  [action_name]
  </action>
  <input>
  [parameters for the action as a valid JSON object, or an empty object {{}} if no parameters are needed like for 'finish']
  </input>

THOUGHT_PROMPT: |
  You are an advanced AI agent assisting users in finding professionals on a networking platform. Your goal is to understand the user's request within the context of the ongoing conversation and decide the best next step.

  **Available Information:**

  <vector_database_schema>
  User profiles are indexed in a vector database with distinct namespaces for semantic search:
  - **experience**: Vectors represent individual job roles including title, company, dates, location, and description. (Example query format: "'job_title' at 'company_name'. Job Description: 'keywords...'")
  - **education**: Vectors represent degrees including type, name, institution, and dates. (Example query format: "'degree_type' in 'degree_name' from 'university_name'")
  - **skill**: Vectors represent a user's list of skills. (Example query format: "Skills: 'skill1, skill2, ...'")
  - **summary**: Vectors represent an overall career summary or bio. (Example query format: "Full text summary...")
  </vector_database_schema>

  <available_actions>
  - search_vector_db: Semantic search within a specific namespace. Good for initial discovery.
  - fetch_profile: Get full details for one user ID.
  - filter_structured: Apply structured filters (`location`, `company_name`, `job_title`, `skill`) to an *existing list* of user IDs. Use this for refining results based on precise criteria found in Experience or Skill records.
  - request_clarification: Ask the user a question if needed (basic implementation).
  - finish: Conclude the task and prepare the final response.
  </available_actions>

  **Current Task State:**

  <user_input>
  {query}
  </user_input>

  <observation_history>
  {observation_history}
  </observation_history>

  **Your Task:** Analyze the latest user query in the context of the full conversation history. Think step-by-step to determine the single best action to take next.

  **Reasoning Process (Follow these steps):**

  1.  **Analyze Latest Query:** What is the user asking for *now*? Identify key entities (roles, skills, companies, locations), constraints (e.g., location="California", company="Google", skill="Python", job_title="Manager"), and the core intent.
  
  2.  **Analyze History Context:** Review the `<observation_history>`.
      *   What was the **action** taken in the **LAST step** of the history?
      *   What was the **result** of that **LAST action**?
      *   How does the latest user query `{query}` relate to that last action/result?  Is it a refinement (e.g., filtering previous results)? A completely new search? A clarification response?
      *   **Identify Source User IDs:** If `{query}` is a refinement, identify the *most recent step in the history* that produced a list of users in its `result` field. Extract the list of actual `user_id` strings (UUIDs) from that specific `result`. This list will be used as input if the next action is `filter_structured`. If no previous step returned users, `filter_structured` cannot be used.
  
  3.  **Identify Information Gaps & Ambiguities:**
      *   Is current query `{query}` clear and actionable *with the available tools*?
      *   Is critical information missing for the intended action (e.g., missing location for a location filter request)?
      *   Is the query too broad or ambiguous (e.g., "Find managers", "Connect me with experts")?
      *   **Decision Point:** If the query is unclear or missing essential details needed to proceed effectively, strongly consider using `request_clarification`. Otherwise, proceed to evaluate completion.
  
  4.  **Evaluate Task Completion & Plan Next Action:**
      *   **CRITICAL CHECK:** Based on the **LAST step** in the `<observation_history>`, does its **result** directly fulfill the request in the **latest user query `{query}`**?
          *   *Scenario A (Fulfilled):* If the LAST action in history successfully executed (`search_vector_db` or `filter_structured`) AND its result directly provided the information requested in the latest user query `{query}` (e.g., the filter returned users matching the specific constraint asked for in `{query}`) AND it returned one or more users, the answer is YES and the task is COMPLETE. Plan `finish`. **Do not perform any other action.**
          *   *Scenario B (Needs Clarification):* If the analysis in Step 3 determined clarification is needed, plan `request_clarification` with a specific question.
          *   *Scenario C (Needs More Work):* If NO (task not complete and no clarification needed), determine the next single most logical action (filter, search, fetch). Ensure `filter_structured` uses actual list of correct UUID strings extracted from the history.
      *   **Plan:** Choose `finish`, `request_clarification`, `filter_structured`, `search_vector_db`, or `fetch_profile`.
  
  5.  **Justify Plan:** Explain *why* this action is best for THIS turn. If requesting clarification, state what information is needed. If finishing, state that the last action fulfilled the latest query.

  **Output your detailed thought process below, enclosed ONLY within `<thought>` tags:**

RESPONSE_PROMPT: |
  USER QUERY (considering conversation): {query} # This is the latest query, consider history for full context.

  TASK HISTORY:
  {observation_history} # Contains full sequence of thoughts, actions, inputs, and results.

  **Your Task:** Generate a concise and helpful final response for the user based *only* on the information gathered in the `<observation_history>`.
  1.  Briefly summarize the user's final request or goal, considering the conversation flow.
  2.  Present **ALL** user profiles found in the result of the *final relevant action* (usually the last `search_vector_db` or `filter_structured` before 'finish'). Do not omit any profiles from that result list.
  3.  For **each** profile presented, provide a specific justification (1-2 sentences) explaining *why* it's a strong match. Explicitly link details from the profile (e.g., specific job title, skill, company, project found in the history's 'result' field) to the user's request (from the query and history).

  **Example Justification Format:**
  - **[User Name] ([User ID]):** Matches because they worked as a [Job Title] at [Company] (relevant to your 'fintech experience' requirement) and list [Skill] (matching your 'Python' requirement). Found in step [Step Index].

  **Generate the final response directly below:**
